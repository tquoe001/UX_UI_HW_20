      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Blankets are needed for children to feel comfort and warmth. The organization, Project Linus, provides homemade
        blankets to children in need across the united states. </p>
      <p>I am a UX/UI design students who worked in a group to redesign this non-profit’s website for a UX/UI bootcamp.
        We were unable to obtain a stakeholder interview due to the current Covid-19 outbreak. Due to this, during our
        heuristics analysis, we probed their website for key performance indicators and for additional insight into the
        needs of the organization. </p>

    <!-- Research-->

    <section>

      <h1 id="research" class="bold">Research</h1>

      <h2 class="bold">Methodology</h2>

      <p>We did a total of 15 remote user tests of the Food and Drug Administration website. Our participants were
        chosen from a pool of friends and family based on convenience. All individuals were middle class Californians in
        their 20s.
      </p>

      <p>We focused on two tasks that we hypothesized that would be utilized by FDA website users:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Find the product recall list spreadsheet on the Recalls, Market, Withdrawals, and Safety Alerts page.
          (Our user testers confirmed they would use the FDA website to search for product recalls)
        </li>
        <li>Find the recent press announcements page.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Task Flow</h2>

      <p>We identified three flows that users took to get to the Recalls, Market, Withdrawals, and Safety Alerts page.
        The blue path was the path that most of our users used to complete this task</p>

      <img class="casestudy_img_flow" src="images/case_study_2/Task flow.png">

      <p>We identified 2 flows that users took to reach the press announcements page. The blue path was where most of
        our participants chose to complete this task.
      </p>

      <img class="casestudy_img_flow" src="images/case_study_2/taskflow_2.png">

      <h2>Usability testing (priority matrix)</h2>
      <p>We found that the FDA website has multiple user identified issues. Of these issues, we will focus on the
        highlight high impact/high priority items.
      </p>

      <img class="casestudy_img" src="images/case_study_2/priority_matrix_1.png">

      <h2>Color test</h2>

      <p>Utilizing Adobe Color(https://color.adobe.com/create/image) we isolated the following colors from the FDA
        website.</p>
        <img class="casestudy_img" src="images/case_study_2/contrast.png">
      

      <h2>Screen reader test</h2>

      <p>Doing a screen reader test using https://accessible-colors.com/ we confirmed that the text used on the FDA
        website meets accessibility requirements. With that in mind, we will retain the color scheme of the website with
        our redesign.
      </p>

      <img class="casestudy_img" src="images/case_study_2/color_check.png">


      <!-- Problem statement-->

      <h1 id="problemstatement" class="bold">Problem statement</h1>

      <p>The FDA website utilizes a user interface that lack a clear hierarchy, unclear drop down, and has inconsistent
        use of button. These navigation issues make the website difficult for users to find the information they need.
      </p>

      <h2>User persona</h2>

      <p>The following persona will help us understand our users. Jennifer is a combination of the insights we received
        from our user testing.
      </p>

      <img id="persona_img" src="images/case_study_2/persona.png">

      <h2>Understanding information architecture</h2>

      <p>We did not get much information on how user would utilize the hamburger navigation menu within the header
        during initial testing. After doing a card sort to reform the information architecture of the site, we did
        further user testing. </p>

      <img id="journey_map_img" src="images/case_study_2/Information Arcitecture@2x.png">

      <h2>Folksonomy and taxonomy</h2>

      <p>We applied the folksonomy & taxonomy method in our government website redesign “FDA.gov “ project to create
        more simplicity for users. This minimizes the size of the content of text by reframing the words. These changes
        were made to our information architecture:
      </p>

        <li>Featured & please be advised to Emergency preparedness and response
        </li>
        <li>Featured Topic to About FDA

        </li>

        <li>1. We got feedback on our drop down size and decided to make it bigger in the next iteration.</li>
        <li>2. We got feedback on the size of the fonts. We decided to use larger font sizes for ease of readability in the
          next iteration.</li>

      </ol>

      <img class="painpoint" src="images/case_study_2/wireframe_painpoint.png">

      <h1>Building a high-fidelity prototype</h1>
      <h2>Style guide
      </h2>

      <p>The style guide was important, especially in a team setting. It allows for consistency in design. It also gives
        one the ability to organize component in an easy to reach place.
      </p>

      <img class="casestudy_img" src="images/case_study_2/Style_guide- components list@2x.png">

      <h2>User testing continued</h2>

      <p>After an additional user test of specifically the navigation bar, we did another priority matrix. We ended up
        making several changes using this as a guide.

      </p>


      <h2>Additional iteration</h2>

      <p>We increased the negative space between the elements in the bread crumb to make it easier to parse from a
        glance.</p>

      <p>Consistency is important. We had some oversight when developing the sight and will focus on the importance of
        detail. Users noticed that there was a lack of consistency with capitalizations. This was fixed with future
        iterations.
      </p>

        </h1>

        <p>Detail is important. Understanding what is important about a content rich site, such as a government website,
          means maintaining the skeleton. It is tempting to remove links that seem unnecessary, but redesigning means
          that link has to exist somewhere. Through card sorting, we were able to reorganize the content to be more
          easily parsable by users. This is reflected by the more balanced and consistent version of the redesigned
          website.
